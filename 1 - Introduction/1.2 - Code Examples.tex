All code examples in this resource use a sudo language that is not meant to be run or compiled directly.
I have chosen to use this approach so that the concepts can be extracted and implemented in any language
on any platform.
By focusing on the concepts at hand rather than specific implementations I can focus on trying to present
the material in a clear and easy to understand manner.

I will cover how to use the sudo language and how to translate it to a useable programming language
in the chapter \pigChapter{Getting Started} in the section titled \pigChapter{Sudo Language}.
